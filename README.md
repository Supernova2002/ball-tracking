# ball-tracking
#A program to track and predict in 2 dimensions the trajectory of a tennis ball. 
#Run the ball tracking program, and then hit the "f" key with the ball in frame, and from there the program will draw a circle on the screen representing the predicted position of the ball as it moves across the camera's vield of view
#For the ball drawing program, follow the same instructions as for the tracking program, and now the tennis ball will draw on the screen wherever it passes. To erase, move a red ball across the camera's field of view, and it will erase any points on the screen in a radius around where it passes.
